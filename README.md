üöÅ AERIE: Autonomous Emergency Reconnaissance & Resource Integration Ecosystem
üìã Problem Statement
PS #2: Drone-Assisted Disaster Recovery (Geek Room)

In the aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or wildfires, rapid response and accurate damage assessment are critical to saving lives and minimizing losses. Traditional disaster response methods often face challenges including:

Limited Access: Ground teams struggle to reach affected areas due to debris, flooding, or infrastructure damage
Time Constraints: Manual reconnaissance is time-consuming, delaying critical rescue operations
Safety Risks: Sending human responders into unstable disaster zones poses significant safety hazards
Inefficient Resource Allocation: Without real-time data, relief supplies may be misdirected or delayed
The Challenge
Design an intelligent drone-based system that can autonomously:

Conduct rapid aerial reconnaissance of disaster zones
Detect and identify survivors, damaged infrastructure, and hazards using AI
Coordinate swarm robotics for efficient area coverage
Prioritize and deliver emergency supplies to the most critical locations
Provide real-time situational awareness to ground control stations
üí° Our Solution: AERIE
AERIE is a dual-platform swarm intelligence system that combines VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) drones for reconnaissance with multi-rotor UAVs for precision delivery. The system leverages AI-powered object detection to identify disaster conditions and automatically coordinates multiple drones to optimize search, rescue, and relief operations.

Key Features
‚úÖ Swarm Coordination: 3 VTOL drones conduct parallel zone reconnaissance
‚úÖ AI-Powered Detection: Custom-trained Roboflow model for disaster scene analysis
‚úÖ Intelligent Prioritization: UAVs automatically target highest-confidence detections
‚úÖ Real-Time Telemetry: 915MHz mesh network for secure, long-range communication
‚úÖ Autonomous Navigation: Pixhawk-based flight control with GPS-guided waypoint navigation

Data Flow Diagrams
DFD Level 0: System Context
(Diagram in ppt)

Description:
The Level 0 DFD shows the high-level system boundaries and external entities. The AERIE system receives disaster zone coordinates from the Ground Control Station (GCS), processes aerial imagery and telemetry data, and outputs detection alerts and mission status back to human operators. The system interfaces with:

Ground Control Station (GCS): Mission planning and monitoring
Disaster Zone: Physical environment being surveyed
Emergency Responders: Recipients of detection data and delivery confirmations
DFD Level 1: Internal Processes
(Diagram in ppt)

Description:
The Level 1 DFD breaks down the AERIE system into four core processes:

Process 1: Reconnaissance (VTOL Swarm)
Input: Mission parameters, zone coordinates
Processing: Parallel aerial scanning, image capture
Output: High-resolution imagery, GPS-tagged photos
Data Store: Aerial Mapping Database
Process 2: AI Assessment (Roboflow Detection)
Input: Aerial imagery from reconnaissance
Processing: Object detection, confidence scoring, classification
Output: Detected objects (survivors, damage, debris), confidence levels
Data Store: Detection Results Database
Process 3: Mission Planning (GCS Coordination)
Input: Detection results, resource availability
Processing: Priority ranking, UAV assignment, route optimization
Output: Mission waypoints, target assignments
Data Store: Mission Plans Database
Process 4: Resource Delivery (UAV Swarm)
Input: Target coordinates, assigned UAVs
Processing: Autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance
Output: Delivery confirmation, updated telemetry
Data Store: Delivery Status Database
Data Flows:

VTOL Drones ‚Üí AI System: Aerial imagery + GPS coordinates
AI System ‚Üí GCS: Detection alerts + confidence scores
GCS ‚Üí UAV Swarm: Target waypoints + priority rankings
UAV Swarm ‚Üí GCS: Telemetry + delivery confirmation

üìñ How It Works: Mission Workflow
Stage 1: Mission Initialization
Ground Control Station defines search area
VTOL swarm receives zone assignments (North, Central, South)

Stage 2: Parallel Reconnaissance
3 VTOL drones deploy simultaneously
Each drone scans assigned zone using grid pattern
High-resolution imagery captured with GPS coordinates

Stage 3: AI-Powered Detection
Aerial imagery sent to Roboflow detection model
AI identifies:
Survivors/People: Requiring immediate assistance
Damaged Buildings: Infrastructure assessment
Debris/Obstacles: Navigation hazards
Fires/Hazards: Environmental threats
Each detection assigned confidence score (0-100%)
Stage 4: GCS Analysis & Prioritization
Ground Control receives all detections
Intelligent Prioritization Algorithm:
Sort all detections by confidence score
